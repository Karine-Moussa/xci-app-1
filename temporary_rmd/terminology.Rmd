**X Chromosome Inactivation (XCI)**: The epigenetic process which silences one X chromosome in females\
to achieve gene dosage balance between males and females. [1]

**Xa**: the active X chromosome\

**Xi**: the inactive X chromosome\

**Xm**: maternally inheritted X chromosome\

**Xp**: paternally inheritted X chromosome\

*color filled in, while the inactive chromosome Xi is represented with no color fill.*\

<br />

**Escape**: The status of genes which are expressed on Xi. These genes "escape" inactivation. 

**Inactive**: The status of genes which are suppressed on Xi.

**Variable**: The status of genes which are expressed on Xi in some tissues/individuals,\
but not in all tissues/individuals. [2]

<br />

**Mosaicism**: Xa and Xi are typically randomly assigned to either Xp or Xm in each\
cell. *Mosaicism* refers to the heterogeneity of Xa/Xi assignment among a set of cells.

**Skew**: A ratio which represents the mosaicism of Xa/Xi assignment in a set of cells.

***Figure 3c: Skew Ratio 3.*** *All four samples have Xi assignment on Xm.*\
*The resulting skew ratio is 0:100. This is a rare occurrence in nature,*\
*and is often referred to has non-random assignment or fully skewed [3]*\

<br />

**%Xi or tau ($\tau$)**: The ratio of a gene's expression on Xi over its total expression across\
both Xa and Xi, referred to as %Xi [4] or $\tau$ [5]. In allele specific expression (ASE)\
based methods for escape inference, $\tau$ is compared to the skew ratio. Significant\
deviation of $\tau$ from the skew ratio reflects biallelic expression and classifies a gene as\
escape.

$N=expression\ level$

$j=gene$

$i=inactive\ x\ chromosome$

$a=active\ x\ chromosome$

$\tau = \frac{N_{ij}}{N_{aj} + N_{ij}}$

*A note about skew: For ASE based methods, data sets with a higher skew ratio (such as 25:75)*\
*are strengthened for estimating escape expression due to the lower Xi expression levels*\
*required to infer significance.*   

**Tau+ ($\tau$+)**: The $\tau$ (or %Xi) values from the subset of XCI calls which were inferred from\
samples which were sufficiently skewed (>25:75). This subset is a more robust estimate of\
ASE and is strengthened for escape calling. [4]
