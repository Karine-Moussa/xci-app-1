-Suppl.Table.1.csv: combined cotton et al (2015) and carrel/willard (2005) escape calls
 - note: to convert suppl.table.1.csv to the proper genome build (hg38), the chromosome positions\
were compiled, and uploaded to [NCBI Genome Remapping Service](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap#)\
The source genome was hg19, the converted genome was hg38.\
The positions were then remapped to fit the GEUVADIS escape calls.

of GTEx dataset (v6p release) for 681 X-chromosomal genes across 29 tissues.\
 - note: to convert suppl.table.5.csv to the proper genome build (hg38), the chromosome positions\
were compiled, and uploaded to [NCBI Genome Remapping Service](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap#)\
The source genome was hg19, the converted genome was hg38.
